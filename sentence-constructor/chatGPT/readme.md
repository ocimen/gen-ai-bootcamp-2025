Response of the GPT :

Almost perfect! Just one small correction:
ðŸš¨ "het straat" is incorrect â†’ It should be "de straat" because straat (street) is a "de" word in Dutch.
âœ… Correct sentence:
"Is dit een gele vogel op de straat?"

> Based on Dutch language result for basic level (A1/A2 level) sentence, it is working quite well.
