Response of the Claude :

Minor grammatical error: "het straat" should be "de straat"
ðŸš¨ "het straat" is incorrect â†’ It should be "de straat" because straat (street) is a "de" word in Dutch.
State: Attempt âœ“
Interpretation: Correct! "Is dit een gele vogel op de straat?" means "Is this a yellow bird on the street?"

> Based on Dutch language result for basic level (A1/A2 level) sentence, it is working quite well.
> especially gves the attempt result with a ok symbol is great.

1st attempt:
I drink water everyday.
Student attempt: Ik drinken water elke dag.
result :
State: Attempt
I see you've made an attempt! Let me help you interpret what you wrote:
"Ik drinken water elke dag" actually translates to "I drink(s) water everyday" - which has a few grammatical errors.

3rd attempt:
State: Attempt :
Your attempt "Ik drank water elkedag" means "I drank water everyday" - which is in past tense, not present tense.
Key Issues:

"Drank" is past tense
"Elkedag" is not standard Dutch (should be "elke dag")

3rd attempt:
State: Attempt âœ“
Perfect! "Ik drink water elke dag" is the correct Dutch translation for "I drink water everyday".
